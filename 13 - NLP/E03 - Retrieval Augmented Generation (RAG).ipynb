So, boy. Why do I see the error as Gaussian? Two \n","reasons, right? One is that it turns out to be mathematically  convenient to do so and the \n","other is, I don’t know, I can also mumble about ju stifications, such as things to the central \n","limit theorem. It turns out that if you, for th e vast majority of problems, if you apply a \n","linear regression model like this and try to m easure the distribution of the errors, not all \n","the time, but very often you find that the erro rs really are Gaussian. That this Gaussian \n","model is a good assumption for the error in regression proble ms like these. Some of you \n","may have heard of the central limit theo rem, which says that the sum of many \n","independent random variables will tend towards a Gaussian. So if the error is caused by many effects, like the mood of th e seller, the mood of the buyer,  some other features that \n","we miss, whether the place has a garden or not, and if all of these e ffects are independent, \n","then by the central limit theorem you might be inclined to believe that the sum of all \n","these effects will be approximately Gaussian. If  in practice, I guess, the two real answers \n","are that, 1.) In practice this is actually a reasonably accurate assumption, and 2.) Is it \n","turns out to be mathematically c onvenient to do so. Okay? Yeah?  \n","Student: It seems like we’re saying if we assu me that area around model has zero mean, \n","then the area is centered ar ound our model. Which it seems al most like we’re trying to \n","assume what we’re trying to prove. Instructor? \n","That’s the [inaudible] but, yes. You are assu ming that the error has zero mean. Which is, \n","yeah, right. I think later this quarter we get to some of the other things, but for now just \n","think of this as a mathematically – it’s act ually not an unreasonabl e assumption. I guess, \n","in machine learning all the assumptions we ma ke are almost never true in the absence \n","sense, right? Because, for instance, housing pric es are priced to dollars and cents, so the \n","error will be – errors in prices are not c ontinued as value random variables, because \n","houses can only be priced at a certain number  of dollars and a certa in number of cents \n","and you never have fractions of cents in housing prices.

Yeah?  \n","Student: So in each update of all the theta Is, you're only using –  \n","Instructor (Andrew Ng) :One training example.  \n","Student: One training example.  \n","Student: [Inaudible]?  \n","Instructor (Andrew Ng) :Let's see, it's definitely a [ina udible]. I believe this theory that \n","sort of supports that as we ll. Yeah, the theory that suppor ts that, the [inaudible] of \n","theorem is, I don't remember.  \n","Okay, cool. So in what I've done so far, I've talked about an iterative algorithm for \n","performing this minimization in terms of J of theta. And it tu rns out that there's another \n","way for this specific problem of least square s regression, of ordinary  least squares. It \n","turns out there's another way to perform this mi nimization of J of thet a that allows you to \n","solve for the parameters theta in close fo rm, without needing to run an iterative \n","algorithm.  \n","And I know some of you may have seen some of what I'm about to do before, in like an \n","undergraduate linear algebra co urse, and the way it's typica lly done requires [inaudible] \n","projections, or taking lots of de rivatives and writing lots of algebra. What I'd like to do is \n","show you a way to derive the closed form solutio n of theta in just a few lines of algebra.  \n","But to do that, I'll need to in troduce a new notation for matrix  derivatives, and it turns out \n","that, sort of, the nota tion I'm about to define here ju st in my own personal work has \n","turned out to be one of the mo st useful things that I actually  use all the time, to have a \n","notation of how to take derivatives with resp ect to matrixes, so that you can solve for the \n","minimum of J of theta with, like, a few lines of algebra rather than  writing out pages and \n","pages of matrices and derivatives.  \n","So then we're going to define this new notati on first and then we'll go ahead and work out \n","the minimization. Given a function J, since J is a function of a vector of parameters theta, \n","right, I'm going to define the deri vative of the gradient of J with respect to theta, as self of \n","vector. Okay, and so this is going to be an N plus one dimensional vector. Theta is an n \n","plus one dimensional vector with indices ranging from zero to N. And so I'm going to \n","define this derivative to be equal to that.  \n","Okay, and so we can actually rewrite the grad ient descent algorithm as follows. This is \n","batch gradient descent, and we  write gradient descent as updating the para meter vector \n","\n","Instructor (Andrew Ng) :Yeah. Let me come back to that later. So it turns out that Y – \n","where did I get this function fr om, right? I just wrote down th is function. It actually turns \n","out that there are two reasons for using this  function that we’ll come to. One is – we \n","talked about generalized linear m odels. We’ll see that this falls out naturally as part of the \n","broader class of models. And another reason th at we’ll talk about ne xt week, it turns out \n","there are a couple of, I think, ve ry beautiful reasons for why we choose logistic functions. \n","We’ll see that in a little bit. But for now let me just define it  and just take my word for it \n","for now that this is a reasonable choice. Okay? But notice now th at my – the values \n","output by my hypothesis will always be between  zero and one. Furthermore, just like we \n","did for linear regression, I’m going to e ndow the outputs and my hypothesis with a \n","probabilistic interpretati on, right? So I’m going to assume that the probability that Y is \n","equal to one given X and parameterized by theta that’s equal to H subscript theta of X, all \n","right? So in other words I’m going to imagin e that my hypothesis is outputting all these \n","numbers that lie between zero and one. I’m going to think of my hypothesis as trying to \n","estimate the probability that Y is equal to one . Okay? And because Y has to be either zero \n","or one then the probability of Y equals zero is  going to be that. All right? So more simply \n","it turns out – actually, take th ese two equations and write them more compactly. Write P \n","of Y given X parameterized by theta. This is going to be H subscript theta of X to the \n","power of Y times one minus H of X to  the power of one minus Y. Okay?  \n","So I know this looks somewhat bizarre, but th is actually makes the variation much nicer. \n","So Y is equal to one then this equation is H of X to the power of one times something to \n","the power of zero. So anything to the power of zero is just one, righ t? So Y equals one \n","then this is something to the pow er of zero and so this is just one. So if Y equals one this \n","is just saying P of Y equals one is equal to H subscript theta of X. Okay? And in the same \n","way, if Y is equal to zero then this is P of Y equals zero equals this thing to the power of \n","zero and so this disappears. This is just one times this thing power of one. Okay? So this \n","is a compact way of writing both of these equatio ns to gather them to one line. So let’s \n","hope our parameter fitting, right? And, again, you can ask – well, given this model by \n","data, how do I fit the parameters theta of my  model? So the likelihood of the parameters \n","is, as before, it’s just the pr obability of theta, right? Which is product over I, PFYI given \n","XI parameterized by theta. Which is – just plugging those in. Okay? I dropped this theta \n","subscript just so you can write a little bit less. Oh, excuse me. These should be XI’s and \n","YI’s. Okay?  \n","So, as before, let’s say we want to find a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters \n","theta. So we want to find the – setting the parameters theta that maximizes the likelihood \n","L of theta. It turns out that very often – ju st when you work with th e derivations, it turns \n","out that it is often much easier to maximize the log of the likelihood rather than maximize \n","the likelihood. So the log likelihood L of theta is just log of capital L. This will, therefore, \n","be sum of this. Okay? And so to fit the para meters theta of our model we’ll find the value \n","of theta that maximizes this log likelihood. Yeah?  \n","Student: [Inaudible]  \n","Instructor (Andrew Ng) :Say that again. \n","\n","regression problem like this. What I want to do today is talk about a class of algorithms \n","called non-parametric learning algorithms that will help to alleviate the need somewhat \n","for you to choose features very carefully. Okay ? And this leads us in to our discussion of \n","locally weighted regression. And just to de fine the term, linear regression, as we’ve \n","defined it so far, is an example of a parame tric learning algorithm. Parametric learning \n","algorithm is one that’s defined as an algorithm that has a fixed number of parameters that \n","fit to the data. Okay? So in linear regression we  have a fix set of parameters theta, right? \n","That must fit to the data. In contrast, what  I’m gonna talk about now is our first non-\n","parametric learning algorithm. The formal defi nition, which is not very  intuitive, so I’ve \n","replaced it with a second, say, more intuitive. The, sort of, formal definition of the non-\n","parametric learning algorithm is that it’s an  algorithm where the number of parameters \n","goes with M, with the size of the training se t. And usually it’s de fined as a number of \n","parameters grows linearly with the size of the training set. Th is is the formal definition. A \n","slightly less formal definition is that th e amount of stuff that your learning algorithm \n","needs to keep around will grow linearly with th e training sets or, in another way of saying \n","it, is that this is an algorithm that we’ll n eed to keep around an entire training set, even \n","after learning. Okay? So don’t worry too much about this de finition. But what I want to \n","do now is describe a specific non-parametric  learning algorithm ca lled locally weighted \n","regression. Which also goes by a couple of other names – which also goes by the name of \n","Loess for self-hysterical reasons. Loess is us ually spelled L-O-E-S-S, sometimes spelled \n","like that, too. I just call it local ly weighted regression. So here ’s the idea. This will be an \n","algorithm that allows us to worry a little b it less about having to choose features very \n","carefully. So for my motivating example, let’s say that I have  a training site  that looks \n","like this, okay? So this is X and that’s Y.  If you run linear regre ssion on this and you fit \n","maybe a linear function to this and you end up with a more or less flat, straight line, \n","which is not a very good fit to  this data. You can sit around a nd stare at this and try to \n","decide whether the features are used right. So maybe you want to toss in a quadratic \n","function, but this isn’t really quadratic eith er. So maybe you want to model this as a X \n","plus X squared plus maybe some function of  sin of X or someth ing. You actually sit \n","around and fiddle with features. And after a wh ile you can probably come up with a set of \n","features that the model is okay, but let’s talk  about an algorithm th at you can use without \n","needing to do that.  \n","So if – well, suppose you want to evaluate  your hypothesis H at a certain point with a \n","certain query point low K is X. Okay? A nd let’s say you want to know what’s the \n","predicted value of Y at this position of X, right? So for lin ear regression, what we were \n","doing was we would fit theta to minimize sum over I, YI minus theta, transpose XI \n","squared, and return theta transpose X. Okay? So that was linear regres sion. In contrast, in \n","locally weighted linear regression you’re goi ng to do things slightly different. You’re \n","going to look at this point X and then I’m going to look in my data set and take into \n","account only the data points that are, sort of, in the little vicinity of X. Okay? So we’ll \n","look at where I want to value my hypothesis. I’m  going to look only in the vicinity of this \n","point where I want to value my hypothesis, and then I’m going to take, let’s say, just \n","these few points, and I will apply linear regression  to fit a straight line just to this sub-set \n","of the data. Okay? I’m using this sub-term sub- set – well let’s come back to that later. So \n","we take this data set and I fit a straight line to it and maybe I get a straight line like that. \n","\n","I'll just show you one example, and this is a rather cool one that two students, Ashutosh \n","Saxena and Min Sun here did, wh ich is given an image like this, right? This is actually a \n","picture taken of the Stanford campus. You can apply that sort of cl ustering algorithm and \n","group the picture into regions. Let me actually blow that up so that you can see it more \n","clearly. Okay. So in the middle, you see the lines sort of groupi ng the image together, \n","grouping the image into [inaudible] regions.  \n","And what Ashutosh and Min did was they then  applied the learning algorithm to say can \n","we take this clustering and us e it to build a 3D model of the world? And so using the \n","clustering, they then had a lear ning algorithm try to learn what the 3D structure of the \n","world looks like so that they could come up with a 3D model that you can sort of fly \n","through, okay? Although many people used to th ink it's not possible to take a single \n","image and build a 3D model, but using a lear ning algorithm and that sort of clustering \n","algorithm is the first step. They were able to.  \n","I'll just show you one more example. I like this  because it's a picture of Stanford with our \n","beautiful Stanford campus. So again, taking th e same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \n","the same sort of unsupervised learning algor ithm, you can group the pixels into different \n","regions. And using that as a pre-processing step, they eventually built this sort of 3D model of Stanford campus in a single picture.  You can sort of walk  into the ceiling, look \n","around the campus. Okay? This actually turned out to be a mix of supervised and \n","unsupervised learning, but the unsupervised lear ning, this sort of cl ustering was the first \n","step.  \n","So it turns out these sorts of unsupervised — clustering algorithms are actually routinely \n","used for many different problems, things like organizing computing clusters, social \n","network analysis, market segmentation, so if you're a marketer and you want to divide your market into different segments or diffe rent groups of people to market to them \n","separately; even for astronomical data an alysis and understanding how galaxies are \n","formed. These are just a sort of small sample  of the applications of unsupervised learning \n","algorithms and clustering algorithms that we 'll talk about later in this class.  \n","Just one particularly cool example of an uns upervised learning algorithm that I want to \n","tell you about. And to motivate that, I'm gonna  tell you about what's called the cocktail \n","party problem, which is imagine that you're at  some cocktail party a nd there are lots of \n","people standing all over. And you know how it is, right, if you're at a large party, \n","everyone's talking, it can be sometimes very hard  to hear even the person in front of you. \n","So imagine a large cocktail party with lots of people. So the problem is, is that all of these people talking, can you separate out the voice of just the person you're interested in \n","talking to with all this  loud background noise?  \n","So I'll show you a specific example in a second, but here's a cocktail party that's I guess \n","rather sparsely attended by just two people.  But what we're gonna do is we'll put two \n","microphones in the room, okay? And so becau se the microphones are just at slightly \n","different distances to the two people, and th e two people may speak in slightly different \n","volumes, each microphone will pick up an overl apping combination of these two people's \n","\n"]}],"source":["question = \"What is central limit theorem\"\n","docs = ensemble_retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)\n","for i in [doc.page_content for doc in docs]:\n","    print(i, '\\n')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bpn9JKKVC8zp"},"source":["### 1.2.3 Multi-Vector Retriever\n","\n","Create multiple vectors per document include:\n","\n","* Smaller chunks: split a document into smaller chunks, and embed those (this is ParentDocumentRetriever).\n","* Summary: create a summary for each document, embed that along with (or instead of) the document.\n","* Hypothetical questions: create hypothetical questions that each document would be appropriate to answer, embed those along with (or instead of) the document."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0Yaem3w_Dc37"},"source":["#### **Parent Document Retrieval**\n","\n","Fetch smaller chunks during retrieval first, then if more than n chunks in top k retrieved chunks are linked to the same parent node (larger chunk).

One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \\n\\nThird, support our veterans. \\n\\nVeterans are the best of us. \\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \\n\\nI know. \\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can. \\n\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \\n\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \\n\\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. \\n\\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. \\n\\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. \\n\\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. \\n\\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. \\n\\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \\n\\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \\n\\nTonight, Danielle—we are. \\n\\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. \\n\\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \\n\\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. \\n\\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \\n\\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease. \\n\\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \\n\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \\n\\nMore support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.  \\n\\nWe will meet the test. \\n\\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \\n\\nWe will save democracy. \\n\\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. \\n\\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp. \\n\\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. \\n\\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity. \\n\\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. \\n\\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union. \\n\\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong. \\n\\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago. \\n\\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. \\n\\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. \\n\\nAnd we will, as one people. \\n\\nOne America. \\n\\nThe United States of America. \\n\\nMay God bless you all.

will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \n","\n","The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \n","\n","Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \n","\n","I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \n","\n","It’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \n","\n","When corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \n","\n","We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \n","\n","During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \n","\n","Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \n","\n","And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \n","\n","That ends on my watch. \n","\n","Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \n","\n","We’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \n","\n","Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \n","\n","Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \n","\n","Let’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \n","\n","And let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \n","\n","When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \n","\n","For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \n","\n","And I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \n","\n","But I also know this. \n","\n","Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \n","we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \n","\n","We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \n","\n","Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \n","\n","Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \n","\n","And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \n","\n","Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \n","\n","I know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \n","\n","We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \n","\n","Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \n","\n","First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \n","\n","We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n","\n","The scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n","\n","We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n","\n","We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n","\n","And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n","\n","If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n","\n","We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n","\n","And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n","\n","Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n","\n","Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n","\n","If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n","\n","And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \n","\n","I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \n","\n","Third – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \n","\n","It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \n","\n","We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \n","\n","Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \n","\n","And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \n","\n","We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n","\n","Of course, continuing this costs money. \n","\n","I will soon send Congress a request. \n","\n","The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \n","\n","Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \n","\n","We’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \n","\n","And we won’t stop. \n","\n","We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n","\n","Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n","\n","Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n","\n","We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n","\n","I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n","\n","They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n","\n","Officer Mora was 27 years old. \n","\n","Officer Rivera was 22. \n","\n","Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n","\n","I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \n","\n","I’ve worked on these issues a long time. \n","\n","I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \n","\n","So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n","\n","Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n","\n","That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \n","\n","That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \n","\n","We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n","\n","I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n","\n","And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \n","\n","And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n","\n","Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n","\n","Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \n","\n","These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \n","\n","The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \n","\n","In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n","\n","We cannot let this happen. \n","\n","Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n","\n","Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n","\n","One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n"]}],"source":["# combine retriever\n","lotr = MergerRetriever(retrievers=[retriever_1, retriever_2])\n","\n","# remove redundant results from both retrievers using yet another embedding\n","# additional document transformer to reorder documents after removing redundancy\n","filter_embed = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\")\n","filter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=filter_embed, similarity_threshold=0.9)\n","reordering = LongContextReorder()\n","pipeline = DocumentCompressorPipeline(transformers=[filter, reordering])\n","compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(\n","    base_compressor=pipeline, base_retriever=lotr\n",")\n","\n","res = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(\"How to deal with bad economy?\")\n","print(f\"Total number of Retrieved Documents: {len(res)}\")\n","print(f'\\n### Result ### \\n: {res[0].page_content}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hUsOWpRsFbCh"},"outputs":[],"source":["# reranking using cohere\n","# from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import CohereRerank\n","# llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n","# compressor = CohereRerank()\n","# compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(\n","#     base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever\n","# )\n","# compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(\n","#     \"What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown\"\n","# )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tCeX_rvI_ItO"},"source":["### 1.2.4 Query Rewriting\n","\n","![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8-iFxfaEAA77Nc?format=jpg&name=900x900)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3262,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703349399653,"user":{"displayName":"Kean Chan","userId":"05792587367281359063"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"ehPrLliH_IQt","outputId":"f828c588-e880-4cce-b82d-d6bbc930c548"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Context: Indicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves the United States Courthouse in New York City, U.S., July 26, 2023.

The example is a pair of sentences and a label indicating how similar they are. The label can be either an integer or a float. E.g. [SNLI Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/snli). The loss function depends on the format of the label. If its an integer use ContrastiveLoss or SoftmaxLoss; if its a float you can use CosineSimilarityLoss. The loss function optimizes such that\n","    * sentences with the closest labels are near in the vector space\n","    * sentences with the farthest labels are as far as possible.\n","\n","2. The example is a pair of positive (similar) sentences without a label. E.g. [Sentence Compression](https://huggingface.co/datasets/embedding-data/sentence-compression?row=0). Having your data in this format can be great since you can use the MultipleNegativesRankingLoss, one of the most used loss functions for Sentence Transformers models.\n","\n","3. The example is a sentence with an integer label. Each sentence has an integer label indicating the class to which it belongs. E.g. [Trec](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trec). This data format is easily converted by loss functions into three sentences (triplets) where the first is an \"anchor\", the second a \"positive\" of the same class as the anchor, and the third a \"negative\" of a different class.You can use BatchHardTripletLoss, which requires the data to be labeled with integers (e.g., labels 1, 2, 3) assuming that samples with the same label are similar. Therefore, anchors and positives must have the same label, while negatives must have a different one.\n","\n","4.  The example is a triplet (anchor, positive, negative) without classes or labels for the sentences. E.g. [QQP_triplets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/embedding-data/QQP_triplets). If you don't have a label for each sentence in the triplets, you should use TripletLoss.

They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues. Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as \"Depression Quest\" and \"Gone Home\", which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional AAA games as downplayed. False claims of the \"ethics in game journalism\" had started as early as 2012, when Geoff Keighley was accused of such unethical behavior when he was presenting information about \"Halo 4\" among advertisements for Mountain Dew and Doritos, an event called \"Doritosgate\" in the gamer culture.\n","\n","title:Gamergate (harassment campaign)\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43758363\n","\n","views:2000\n","\n","\n","item 1\n","lang:en\n","\n","text:\"Rolling Stone\" stated Jackson's Super Bowl performance \"is far and away the most famous moment in the history of the Super Bowl halftime show\". \"PopCrush\" called the performance \"one of the most shocking moments in pop culture\" as well as a \"totally unexpected and unforgettable moment\". \"Gawker\" ranked the performance among the most recent of the \"10 Shows that Advanced Sex on Television\", commenting the set \"had all the elements of a huge story\" and \"within seconds the world searched furtively for pictures\", concluding \"it remains so ubiquitous, it's impossible to look at a starburst nipple shield without thinking \"Janet Jackson\"\". \"E!

A study of television's most impactful moments of the last 50 years conducted by Sony Electronics and the Nielsen Television Research Company ranked Jackson's Super Bowl performance at #26. The incident was the only Super Bowl event on the list and the highest music and entertainment event aside from the death of Whitney Houston. TV Guide Network ranked it at #2 in a 2010 special listing the \"25 Biggest TV Blunders\". \"Complex\" stated \"It's the Citizen Kane of televised nip-slips—so unexpected, and on such a large stage, that nothing else will ever come close. If Beyoncé were to whip out both breasts and put on a puppet show with them when she performs this year in New Orleans, it would rate as just the second most shocking Super Boob display. Janet's strangely ornamented right nipple is a living legend, and so is Justin Timberlake's terrified reaction.\" Music channel Fuse listed it as the most controversial Super Bowl halftime show, saying the \"revealing performance remains (and will forever remain) the craziest thing to ever happen at a halftime show. Almost immediately after the incident, the FCC received a flood of complaints from parents who just wanted their children to enjoy a nice, wholesome three hours of grown men inflicting damaging and long-lasting pain on each other for sport. Halftime shows would never be the same.\" Patrick Gipson of \"Bleacher Report\" ranked it as #1 in its list of the most \"Jaw Dropping Moments of the Last Decade\", stating Janet \"changed the landscape of live television forever\". Gipson explained \"It prompted a million mothers to cover their eyes, fathers and sons to jump out of their seats in shock and numerous sanctions by the Federal Communications Commission, including a US$550,000 fine against CBS. Talk about a halftime show that will be hard to top.\" The incident was also declared \"the most memorable Super Bowl halftime show in history\", as well as \"the most controversial\", adding \"you can't talk about this halftime show, or any subsequent halftime show from here to eternity, without mentioning the wardrobe malfunction\".\n","\n","title:Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=498971\n","\n","views:2000\n","\n","\n","item 2\n","lang:en\n","\n","text:West Germany (established in May 1949) was not eligible for the 1950 World Cup (the first after the war), and so all preparations were made with a view toward the 1954 matches in Bern, Switzerland. By that time Adidas's football boots were considerably lighter than the ones made before the war, based on English designs. At the World Cup Adi had a secret weapon, which he revealed when West Germany made the finals against the overwhelmingly favored Hungarian team, which was undefeated since May 1950 and had defeated West Germany 8–3 in group play. Despite this defeat, West Germany made the knock-out rounds by twice defeating Turkey handily. The team defeated Yugoslavia and Austria to reach the final (a remarkable achievement), where the hope of many German fans was simply that the team \"avoid another humiliating defeat\" at the hands of the Hungarians. The day of the final began with light rain, which brightened the prospects of the West German team who called it \"\"Fritz Walter-Wetter\"\" because the team's best player excelled in muddy conditions. Dassler informed Herberger before the match of his latest innovation—\"screw in studs.\" Unlike the traditional boot which had fixed leather spike studs, Dassler's shoe allowed spikes of various lengths to be affixed depending on the state of the pitch. As the playing field at Wankdorf Stadium drastically deteriorated, Herberger famously announced, \"Adi, screw them on.\" The longer spikes improved the footing of West German players compared to the Hungarians whose mud-caked boots were also much heavier. The West Germans staged a come from behind upset, winning 3-2, in what became known as the \"Miracle in Bern.\" Herberger publicly praised Dassler as a key contributor to the win, and Adidas's fame rose both in West Germany, where the win was considered a key post-war event in restoring German self-esteem and abroad, where in the first televised World Cup final viewers were introduced to \"the ultimate breakthrough.\"\n","\n","title:Adolf Dassler\n","\n","url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2373164\n","\n","views:2000\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["def keyword_search(\n","    query,\n","    results_lang='en',\n","    properties = [\"title\", \"url\", \"text\"],\n","    num_results=3):\n","\n","    where_filter = {\n","        \"path\": [\"lang\"],\n","        \"operator\": \"Equal\",\n","        \"valueString\": results_lang\n","    }\n","\n","    response = (\n","        client.query.get(\"Articles\", properties)\n","        .with_bm25(query=query)\n","        .with_where(where_filter)\n","        .with_limit(num_results)\n","        .do()\n","        )\n","\n","    result = response['data']['Get']['Articles']\n","    return result\n","\n","def print_result(result):\n","    \"\"\" Print results with colorful formatting \"\"\"\n","    for i,item in enumerate(result):\n","        print(f'item {i}')\n","        for key in item.keys():\n","            print(f\"{key}:{item.get(key)}\")\n","            print()\n","        print()\n","\n","# examples\n","query = \"What is the most viewed televised event?\"\n","properties = [\"text\", \"title\", \"url\", \"views\", \"lang\"]\n","keyword_search_results = keyword_search(query, properties=properties)\n","print_result(keyword_search_results)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WO5JNhFt_GAH"},"source":["## 2.2 Dense Retrieval\n","\n","Semantic Search based on distance of embedding"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ekozWtz_DEN8"},"source":["### 2.2.1 Querying"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3483,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692503088944,"user":{"displayName":"Kean Chan","userId":"05792587367281359063"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"L0w7Lt6r841w","outputId":"1c720adb-6e1f-4c89-bde7-1231f1de8812"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["item 0\n","_additional:{'distance': -148.99521}\n","\n","lang:en\n","\n","text:Robert Pershing Wadlow (February 22, 1918 July 15, 1940), also known as the Alton Giant and the Giant of Illinois, was a man who was the tallest person in recorded history for whom there is irrefutable evidence.

A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not always straightforward. Over many years, I’ve been privileged to see thousands of students as well as engineers in companies large and small navigate careers in AI. In this and the next few letters, I’d like to share a few thoughts that might be useful in charting your own course.\n","\n","Three key steps of career growth are learning (to gain technical and other skills), working on projects (to deepen skills, build a portfolio, and create impact) and searching for a job. These steps stack on top of each other:\n","\n","Initially, you focus on gaining foundational technical skills.\n","After having gained foundational skills, you lean into project work. During this period, you’ll probably keep learning.\n","Later, you might occasionally carry out a job search. Throughout this process, you’ll probably continue to learn and work on meaningful projects.\n","These phases apply in a wide range of professions, but AI involves unique elements. For example:\n","\n","AI is nascent, and many technologies are still evolving. While the foundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — and coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these foundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more important in AI than fields that are more mature.\n","Project work often means working with stakeholders who lack expertise in AI. This can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s timeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the highly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project management: How can you come up with a plan for building a system when you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target accuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may be necessary to address post-deployment drift.\n","While searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in other sectors, there are some differences. Many companies are still trying to figure out which AI skills they need and how to hire people who have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different than anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to educate potential employers about some elements of your work.\n","Throughout these steps, a supportive community is a big help. Having a group of friends and allies who can help you — and whom you strive to help — makes the path easier. This is true whether you’re taking your first steps or you’ve been on the journey for years.\n","\n","I’m excited to work with all of you to grow the global AI community, and that includes helping everyone in our community develop their careers. I’ll dive more deeply into these topics in the next few weeks.\n","\n","Last week, I wrote about key steps for building a career in AI: learning technical skills, doing project work, and searching for a job, all of which is supported by being part of a community. In this letter, I’d like to dive more deeply into the first step.\n","\n","More papers have been published on AI than any person can read in a lifetime. So, in your efforts to learn, it’s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical career in machine learning are:\n","\n","Foundational machine learning skills. For example, it’s important to understand models such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts behind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, optimization algorithms, and error analysis.\n","Deep learning. This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel in the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, practical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, sequence models, and transformers.\n","Math relevant to machine learning. Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various manipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes rule, and hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other methods to systematically explore a dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve found EDA particularly useful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can really help drive progress! Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. In a previous letter, I described how the math needed to do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, improved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural network architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.\n","Software development. While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine learning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software to implement complex AI systems. These skills include programming fundamentals, data structures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames), algorithms (including those related to databases and data manipulation), software design, familiarity with Python, and familiarity with key libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\n","This is a lot to learn! Even after you master everything in this list, I hope you’ll keep learning and continue to deepen your technical knowledge. I’ve known many machine learning engineers who benefitted from deeper skills in an application area such as natural language processing or computer vision, or in a technology area such as probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems.\n","\n","How do you gain these skills? There’s a lot of good content on the internet, and in theory reading dozens of web pages could work. But when the goal is deep understanding, reading disjointed web pages is inefficient because they tend to repeat each other, use inconsistent terminology (which slows you down), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That’s why a good course — in which a body of material has been organized into a coherent and logical form — is often the most time-efficient way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. When you’ve absorbed the knowledge available in courses, you can switch over to research papers and other resources.\n","\n","Finally, keep in mind that no one can cram everything they need to know over a weekend or even a month. Everyone I know who’s great at machine learning is a lifelong learner. In fact, given how quickly our field is changing, there’s little choice but to keep learning if you want to keep up. How can you maintain a steady pace of learning for years? I’ve written about the value of habits. If you cultivate the habit of learning a little bit every week, you can make significant progress with what feels like less effort.\n","\n","In the last two letters, I wrote about developing a career in AI and shared tips for gaining technical skills. This time, I’d like to discuss an important step in building a career: project work.\n","\n","It goes without saying that we should only work on projects that are responsible and ethical, and that benefit people. But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. I wrote previously about how to identify and scope AI projects. This and next week’s letter have a different emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.\n","\n","A fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact over time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to bigger projects as your skills grow.\n","\n","When you’re starting out, don’t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. Many people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes — even small ones — under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better ideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.\n","\n","What if you don’t have any project ideas? Here are a few ways to generate them:\n","\n","Join existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\n","Keep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of time reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’m confident that you will, too.\n","Focus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology — say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is hard. But the variety of applications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to have been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to online advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on those applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore the possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative application — one where you can do unique work — that no one else has done yet.\n","Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not develop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn’t part of my “job” (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often worked on out of passion for education. My early experiences recording videos at home helped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley abounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. So long as it doesn’t create a conflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.\n","Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into? Here’s a quick checklist of factors to consider:\n","\n","Will the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to stretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you on a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.\n","Do you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things with? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge impact on your growth.\n","Can it be a stepping stone? If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/or business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? (If the project is bigger than those you’ve worked on before, there’s a good chance it could be such a stepping stone.)\n","Finally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn’t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to work on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over the course of your career, so you’ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what’s worthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional “ready, aim, fire” approach, you can accelerate your progress with “ready, fire, aim.”\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Clean up to remove empty spaces and new lines\n","texts = text.split('\\n\\n')\n","texts = np.array([t.strip(' \\n') for t in texts if t])\n","\n","question = \"Are side projects important when you are starting to learn about AI?\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1066,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692505972105,"user":{"displayName":"Kean Chan","userId":"05792587367281359063"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"nrgALJlpNrq0","outputId":"69f0aaac-9947-4724-8619-6f3f09f53359"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"execution_count":31,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# build search idnex\n","response = co.embed(texts=texts.tolist(),).embeddings\n","embeds = np.array(response)\n","search_index = AnnoyIndex(embeds.shape[1], 'angular')\n","for i in range(len(embeds)):\n","    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])\n","search_index.build(10) # 10 trees\n","search_index.save('test.ann')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":561,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692506013266,"user":{"displayName":"Kean Chan","userId":"05792587367281359063"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"S6Gc9GWrN5QW","outputId":"d62fdee2-1378-43cb-8f6d-3fc1902cb165"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Join existing projects.
