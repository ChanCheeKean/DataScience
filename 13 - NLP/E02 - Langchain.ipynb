It is called \"black body\" because an idealized object that perfectly absorbs all radiation without reflecting or transmitting any appears black.\\n\\nWhen an object is heated, it emits radiation at different wavelengths or frequencies, which depend on its temperature. Black body radiation follows a specific pattern called Planck\\'s law, which describes the intensity of the radiation at different wavelengths. As the temperature increases, the peak intensity shifts towards shorter wavelengths, corresponding to more energetic photons.\\n\\nOne important aspect of black body radiation is its color. At low temperatures, the radiation is primarily in the infrared range and not visible to the human eye. As the temperature increases, the object starts to glow red, then orange, and eventually becomes white-hot as the radiation spans the visible spectrum.\\n\\nBlack body radiation has been crucial in understanding quantum mechanics and the concept of quantized energy levels. Max Planck, a physicist, introduced Planck\\'s law to explain the observed experimental data, which ultimately led to the development of quantum theory.\\n\\nIn summary, black body radiation refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an object that perfectly absorbs all incident radiation.
